#### A collection of GameDev-related links and information on learning game development. This is to supplement the course material and guide you to other resources to further your knowledge and abilities in game development!

_To be a top-level game developer and software engineer, you must always be looking for ways to increase your skills and knowledge. Iâ€™ve linked some online resources that you can learn some invaluable information and get ahead of the game ðŸ˜Š._

### C++
C++ is the predominate language for developing game engines and high-performance code. It is used throughout the software industry because of its speed, access to hardware, and size. It has been around for decades and does not look like it will be replaced anytime soon.

**Tutorials:**

**Guidelines (advanced):**

### Design Patterns
Design patterns are solutions to common programming problems that occur frequently in development. They can be used to help solve a problem but are not necessary the exact solution but can steer you in a direction that may be helpful.

This is an excellent on-line book on how to apply design patterns to game programming. Highly recommended!

### Math
To be an excellent game developer, you need to build your math skills. You may not work at a low level and deal with matrices and other formulas but having the knowledge of how vectors are transformed is essential in the industry. Much of the math required is contained in linear algebra and trigonometry.
The top concepts you need to know:
+ Vectors
+ Matrices
+ Rotations (Quaternions)
+ Dot Product
+ Cross Product

Excellent book that is now free online:

### Game Development
Of course, this is what weâ€™re here for. It is important that we understand the core components of software engineering and the math involved in transforming objects in space, but game design and programming concepts get us to where we want to be.

Excellent channel that contains a lot of information on game design theory:
