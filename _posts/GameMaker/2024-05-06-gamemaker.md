### About GameMaker
**GameMaker**, originally named Animo and later Game Maker until 2011, is a collection of cross-platform game engines created by Mark Overmars in 1999 and has been developed by YoYo Games since 2007. The engine was rebranded as **GameMaker Studio 2** in 2017, and its latest version, simply called **GameMaker**, was released in 2022. This platform supports the development of cross-platform and multi-genre video games through a custom drag-and-drop visual programming interface or a more complex scripting language known as GameMaker Language (GML). Initially designed to help novices create games without extensive programming experience, **GameMaker** has evolved to also cater to advanced developers with its comprehensive features. Primarily focused on 2D graphics, **GameMaker** allows developers to publish games on a variety of platforms, including Microsoft Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, HTML5, Android, iOS, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Raspberry Pi, and Microsoft UWP, as well as major gaming consoles like PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One. Additionally, support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S was announced in February 2021.
